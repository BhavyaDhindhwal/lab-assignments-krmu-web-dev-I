                <h2>India Won </h2>
                <p>Published on: September 29, 2025</p>
                <p>With eight runs needed from the last five balls, Tilak Varma launched Haris Rauf for a six over mid-wicket to effectively seal the Asia Cup 2025 in India's favour. Rinku Singh then hit a four off the only ball he faced in the tournament to help India get over the line in a tense game in Dubai. However, if the game itself was tense, what transpired after the match was filled with even more tension.
                    What happened after India vs Pakistan final?
                    Indian players were interviewed by broadcasters from their own country as they revealed their feelings about the victory. Time kept passing as nobody knew when the presentation would finally take place if at all it will.</p>
